# QuipXML

QuipXml is chainable PHP objects for manipulating XML.
Unlike other libraries that attempt to replicate jQuery syntax throughout,
Quip attempts to provide lightweight extensions to SimpleXML to facilitate
cleaner code without imposing JavaScript conventions on a PHP project.
The end result is fast and easy to use.
